## Add New Component Category

 - Create a new directory inside the `app` directory with the name of the component, for example `action-bar`. The name of the directory will be prettified and will become the component section header. Create a file named `overview.md` and place the general overview text for the component. You **cannot** use code snippets here.
 - If the directory should be displayed as a folder inside the documentation tree, it should end with `-category`. For example - `ns-ui-widgets-category`.

## Add New Example

 - Create a new directory inside a component directory, for example inside the `button` directory. The name of the directory will be prettified and will become the example header, i.e. title. For example, if your directory name is `tap-event` the header will become `Tap Event`, that is, all dashes will be replaced with spaces and all the words will be capitalized.
 - Create a file named `article.md`. Place the article text and code snippet placeholders there. You can place code snippets in TypeScript, HTML and CSS. The code snippet placeholder syntax is explained [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/markdown-snippet-injector). Here is a sample article.md file:

######article.md
```
Set Button tap callback in TypeScript file
<snippet id='button-tap-ts'/>

Set Button tap callback in JavaScript file
<snippet id='button-tap-javascript'/>

Set Button in XML
<snippet id='button-tap-xml'/>
```
 - Add your example source code files, i.e. `.ts`, `.xml`, and `.css` files. These files should contain the actual code snippets to be injected in `article.md`. For example:

######text.component.html
```XML
<StackLayout sdkExampleTitle sdkToggleNavButton>
    <StackLayout  class="example-container">
        <!-- >> button-tap-xml -->
        <Button id="button" text="I am a button" tap="onTap"></Button>
        <!-- << button-tap-xml -->
    </StackLayout>
</StackLayout>
```

######text.component.js
```JavaScript
import {EventData} from "@nativescript/core";
import {Button} from "@nativescript/core";

// >> button-tap-javascript 
export function onTap(args) {
    var myButton = args.object;
    console.log(myButton + " was tapped!");
}
// << button-tap-javascript
```


######text.component.ts
```TypeScript
import { EventData } from "@nativescript/core";
import { Button } from "@nativescript/core";

// >> button-tap-ts 
export function onTap(args: EventData) {
    let myButton = <Button>args.object;
    console.log(myButton + " was tapped!");
}
// << button-tap-ts 
```
 - (Optional) Make Ð° screenshot of your example named `image.png` and add it to the example directory. Here is an image with android and ios phone screenshots:

|Image|
|---|
|![Image](app/ns-ui-widgets-category/button/image.png "Image")|

 - Finally, add your example to the main navigation list:

######app/main-view-model.ts
```TypeScript
var mainMenuLinks = [
    new Link("Button", "/button"),
    ...
];
```

 - Tests - for the time being the tests will be provided by the NativeScript QA team when the PR is accepted.
